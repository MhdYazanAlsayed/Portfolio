                  A purpose-built task management module—similar in spirit to
                  Trello but tailored to the company’s workflows—designed to
                  automate operations across departments. The system is fully
                  aligned with the central employee hierarchy, enabling managers
                  and staff to plan, assign, track, and report on work with the
                  right level of visibility and control.
                </p>

                    <li>
                      Employees can create personal tasks for self-tracking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Managers can create tasks for any direct or indirect
                      reports within their organizational tree.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Visibility rules:

                        <li>Only assigned users can view a task.</li>
                        <li>
                          Managers can view tasks delegated by other managers to
                          shared or downstream teams (as permitted by
                          hierarchy).
                        </li>

                          <strong>One-time Tasks</strong> — executed once, with
                          a target start and due date.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Recurring Tasks</strong> — repeat on a
                          schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, or custom cadence).
                        </li>

                    <li>
                      Tasks can be temporarily paused (disabled) and later

                    By combining hierarchy-aware permissions, recurring

                      By allowing managers to assign tasks directly within the

                      reduced time wasted on coordination, leading to faster

                      By centralizing task management in a single platform
                      (instead of relying on multiple tools like Trello or
                      email), the company reduced software costs and minimized
                      inefficiencies.
